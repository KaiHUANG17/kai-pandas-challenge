## Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

There are two main trends

## Trends
There are 15 schools with 39,170 students and a total budget of $24,649,428. The average score is 70.34 in math, 69.98 in reading, 84.43% in reading and 86.08% in math. Overall, the students' math pass rate was slightly higher than the reading pass rate, 1.65 percent higher on average, and their math score was 0.36 points higher than the reading average. It is important to know that these schools are different types, there are government or independent. Bailey High School, which has the most students, 4976 students. It also has the largest budget, $3,124,928.00. But its overall pass rate is only third, with the top two being independent. And the three lowest pass rates are all government schools

Schools that spend between $585 and $630 have higher pass rates than those in other districts. The same schools with fewer students have higher pass rates. independent schools also get better results than state schools

It is worth mentioning that when the number of students in a school increases, the average math score, the average reading score, the math pass rate, the reading pass rate, and the overall pass rate all decrease. Therefore, we can infer that when the number of students increases, it will have a negative impact on student achievement. Therefore, schools should try to solve the problem of the number of students in schools and classes, because it directly affects students' achievements.
